        It never gets old when Michael Scott messes up well-known phrases and adds his own touch to them. And no one ever corrects him! It’s hilarious. He gets away with a lot on The Office, and his made-up sayings are included.

        Michael Scott:  I’ve got to make sure that YouTube comes down to tape this.

        Michael is probably the most gullible character on The Office, along with Erin. You could trick him into anything, and his innocence and good intentions is what makes him so redeemable as a character.

        Michael Scott:  I learned a while back, that if I don’t text 911 people will not return my calls. Um, but now people always return my calls because, they think that something horrible, has happened.
        
        Michael Scott:  Jim and I are great friends. We hang out a ton, mostly at work.
        
        Michael Scott:  That’s what she said!
        
        Michael Scott:  You are as creepy as a real serial killer. For real.
        
        Michael Scott:  I’m not a millionaire. I thought I would be by the time I was 30, but I wasn’t even close. Then I thought maybe by 40, but by 40, I had less money than I did when I was 30.

So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill. Then I go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill, I go back to sleep again. Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon.
        
        Michael Scott:  Toby is in HR, which technically means he works for corporate. So he’s not really a part of our family. Also, he’s divorced, so he’s not really a part of his family.
        
        Everyone loves how much Michael hates Toby on The Office. There’s a fan theory floating around claiming the reason why he feels so strongly towards him. As Mental Floss reported, this theory says that because Michael had a tough upbringing with a broken home, he resents Toby for not being able to make his own marriage work. It’s definitely a stretch, but hey, people care enough about their relationship to make up theories, which is pretty funny.

He also has a thing about age and getting older, as evidenced when he discovered how old Pam’s mom Helene was on her birthday. That scene is still so cringe-worthy!
